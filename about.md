Hi! I am a Brazilian Software Engineering undergraduate student from the University of Brasilia currently studying and living at University of Alabama at Birmingham, in USA. I came to study for a whole year fully funded by the Science without Borders program, which was created for students of excellence from Brazil by our government.

For now my major interests are about software development, entrepreneurship, user experience and information security. My major programming experience is using Java but I'm also studying Ruby, Ruby on Rails and Swift by myself. In the past I've also created some cool small projects using Arduino and Android.

I'm currently looking for a summer internship in USA, if you have something cool for me or want to see my CV please send me an <a href="mailto:{{ site.email }}">email</a> or a [tweet](http://www.twitter.com/ar4gorn/)! I really want to use my last months in USA for getting amazing experiences here and for learning more about the local entrepreneur and tech culture.
